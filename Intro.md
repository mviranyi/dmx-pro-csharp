# Introduction #

this is a place holder for many small projects related to my quest for a personlized lighting controller for my thearter troupe. We needed a solution that would allow us to control our many shows (typically 40ish shows and 2 musicals a year) that would allow for flexible operation as well as on the fly changes (we have very young kids, acting some of them cant read, it makes learning lines hard) the idea is to start with a simple controller and work my way up to something that can be on par with a dedicated lighting console.


# Projects #

## Basic Light Board ##
This has expanded from its original intent (a 24 channel XY crossfader) to a fully fledged memory board.
features include:
  * Cues
  * go button
  * record cue
  * blind cue editing
  * command interface for cueing up scenes (1>10@50%,15@75% or 1>10@128,15@192)
  * and more that i cant think of atm...

# Currently Under Development #
since death of a salesman has gone up successfully i have stopped working on this for the time being to devote time to my (unrelated) masters thesis project.

# future work #
add sub masters.
add better intelegent light control.Specificly:
  * moving fixtures
  * gobo options
  * gel options
  * full RGB color control
